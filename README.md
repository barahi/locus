## Why would someone use it?

For people who struggle with forgetfulness, this app can be a game-changer. With this app, you can easily create and manage your shopping list, grouping items based on their location and providing reminders when you're near a store where an item on your list can be found. This can help ensure that you don't forget to purchase important items, saving you time and frustration in the long run. Additionally, this app allows you to easily add or remove items, which can be helpful for people who often forget things or need to make changes on-the-go. With a clear and organized list of items, you can streamline your shopping experience and avoid the stress of forgetting something important. If you struggle with forgetfulness, this app could be the perfect solution to help you stay organized and on top of your shopping needs.

## How would the application work ?

1. User inputs the items they need to buy into an app or website.
2. The AI system will analyze the user's input and categorize the items by their type, such as groceries, household items, or personal care.
3. The system will also identify the user's current location using GPS, which can be accessed through the user's device.
4. The AI system will then create a shopping list based on the user's current location, grouping items by store or section of the store.
5. The system can use machine learning to suggest additional items the user may need based on their previous shopping history, purchase patterns, or frequently bought items.
6. The user can then view their shopping list and check off items as they are purchased.
7. The system can also provide real-time updates on store inventory, prices, and promotions, enabling users to make informed purchasing decisions.
